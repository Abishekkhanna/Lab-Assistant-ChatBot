# Smart Biotech Lab Assistant

**Smart Biotech Lab Assistant** is an AI chatbot designed to assist biotech researchers with everyday lab tasks. The assistant helps in setting reminders for experiments, tracking lab inventory, and answering common biotech-related questions. It is built using **Python** and designed to be run in a **Jupyter Notebook**.

## Team

We are a team of four members:
- **Abishek Khanna** (myself)
- **Yuvaraj**
- **Amuthan**
- **Roobis**

We collaboratively developed this tool to enhance lab efficiency and reduce administrative burdens in biotech research environments.

## Features

- **Set Experiment Reminders**: Schedule and track time-sensitive experiments.
- **Lab Inventory Management**: Monitor and manage chemicals, reagents, and consumables in real-time.
- **Biotech Knowledge Base**: Answer common biotech-related questions with information on protocols, chemical properties, and safety measures.
- **Adaptive Suggestions**: Provides quantity ranges for chemicals and tips on optimizing lab results based on experimental context.
- **User Feedback Loop**: Collects user feedback post-experiment to refine future suggestions.
